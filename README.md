# Traffic Classification directly on spectrum data
This repository contains the code the can be used to reproduce the results in the paper: "A General Approach for Traffic Classification in Wireless Networks using Deep Learning".  
- The dataset can be downladed from [https://zenodo.org/record/5208201](https://zenodo.org/record/5208201)
- The preprint (paper still under review) can be found at [https://zenodo.org/record/5236573 ](https://zenodo.org/record/5236573) 

This repo will be updated according to the following planning:  

##Python code
- ~~Notebook with code showing how to load and partition the dataset for the training and testing the models~~ -> Done
- Notebook with code showing how to train the CNN and RNN -> WIP
- Notebook with code showing how to train a CNN and Gradient Boost based algorithm on the byte representation of the data.

##Matlab code
-Scripts to generate waveforms using L2 (bytes) payload.
