# Traffic Classification directly on spectrum data
This repository contains the code the can be used to reproduce the results in the paper: "A General Approach for Traffic Classification in Wireless Networks using Deep Learning".  
- The dataset can be downladed from [https://zenodo.org/record/5208201](https://zenodo.org/record/5208201)
- The preprint (paper still under review) can be found at [https://zenodo.org/record/5236573 ](https://zenodo.org/record/5236573)
